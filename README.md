# DevOps
All my DevOps work will be submitted here.

------
**As per architecture We needed 3 machines, (EC2-A, EC2-B and EC2-C).
EC2-A (redhat linux) will be having ansible installed on it.
EC2-B will be used as a machine to install Jenkins tool.
We will generate ssh key on EC2-A , without password and use it to connect to EC2-B machine.**
